            <h1>Tucmcari's History</h1>
            <p>Tucumcari is full of rich and exciting history. Althought it may not have been officially started as a town until 1901, it has evidence of people living in this area about 10,000 years ago. Tucumcari was also once a place that the dinosaurs roamed and left their mark.In fact, at our local community college there is a paleontology program where students excavate local dinossaur bones and fossils. To show their hard work and effort, they even have their own dinosaur museum!</p>
    <p>
    Moving up in the timeline of history a bit, this town used to be the stomping grounds of the Anasazi Indains. Believe it or not, this part of Eastern New Mexico is great for growing gardens and they must have known that as there is evidence that they used this land for farming and trading. After the Anasazis came the Apaches, Comanches, and other tribes. They used this land for it's great hunting grounds. Tucumcari's name actually originated from the Comanche word, "tukanukaru." That words means "to lie in wait for something to approach." Which fits very well with it being known for it's hunting.</p>
    <p>
        In 1901 Tucumcari was offically settled as a town. At first, it was a tent city and acquired the name of "Ragtown" as the the town developed more and, being by the railroads, it was named "Six Shooter Siding." Within a short eight years, Six Shooter Siding had become a major point for the railroad and was renamed Tucumcari.
     </p>
    <p>
    Tucumcari continued to grow and expand and attracted over 60 businesses. In 1926 Route 66 came to town bringing thousands of new travelers. With that came new shops, hotels, restaurants, gas stations, and businesses in general. In years to come I-40 also made it's way to Tucumcari and helps provide a steady stream of new people to this beautiful city.</p>
