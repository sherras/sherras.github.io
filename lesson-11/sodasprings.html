    <h2>Tips to Planning Your Soda Springs Trip</h2>
    <img src="images/png/snowlake400.png" alt='Snowy Lake'>

    <p>Soda Springs is a beatiful place. There is so much history and life here. If you have never been here before, here are some things to consider when planning and trip. First, you should check the weather, rain or shine, this place is always majestic, but you may want to look so you can do the activities that excite you most. For the snowy weather there are many things you can do here. Ice fishing is a big hit. If you have never tried it before, stop by The Weather Heather Office and we can tell you all about it and get you connected with a guide if you would like. There is also a wonderful ski resort up the mountain. So bring your skis, snowboards, sleds, or leave them and save the space, they rent them at a good price here, and enjoy a wonderful ski trip with your family.
        For the summer weather, we have a plethora of amazing hikes in our gorgeous mountains. We even have hikes that lead up to our wonderful hot springs. The water is extremely clear, clean, and beatiful. Bring your goggles and come take a dive. We also have cool springs. Enjoy some fresh water on your hike from them. Coming in the fall? Enjoy our beatiful trees full of color and participate in our October fest. No matter what time of year you come, there is always something to do here. Another we suggest is to plan at least a few days, there are many state parks around here that are very beautiful to visit as well. Our town also has events throughout the month that are fun to attend like local music jam sessions, bingo nights, and more! Lastly, we suggest you try to forget about the world, so put away the laptop and phone and just enjoy the world in the here and now! We cannot wait to have you come!
