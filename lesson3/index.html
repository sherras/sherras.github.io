    <h2> Our Purpose</h2>
    <p>We at The Weather Heather are here to bring the weather to you and you to the weather. We want us all to be connected and share what we know about our weather. We will keep you posted on what is happenning and you keep us posted on tips for handeling it. Feel free to share things like what you and your family do on a rainy day, how do you prepare for snow, how do you like to teach your children what to do during a tornado, or anything else you think would be useful! Let's keep up to date and let's share with each other! </p>
