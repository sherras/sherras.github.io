    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p>Our target audience for this site will be adults in the 20-50 age range. We are wanting it make it a site that people will want to come and see and contribute. We will aim toward parents, teachers, and anyone interested in weather fun facts and ideas.</p>
    <h3>Personas</h3>
    <p>One group I think would like our site is parents. Parents have a lot of planning to do. With kids having different events, appointments to go to, work assignments to accomplish; it is nice to know what the weather will be like, and get some useful tips on what to do if the weather is not in your favor. From this site they will be able to expect accurate weather reports, ideas for fun/useful activities to do for the corresponding weather, and tips for how to go on with necessary tasks when the weather isn't the most cooperative.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Another audience we would like to target is elementary - high shcool teachers. There is a point in education where students learn about the weather. A teacher could use this site as a helpful and fun resource for students to learn and even participate in helping others learn more about the weather. We will provide accurate weather predictions, offer fun facts about weather and why it happens (to help with the educational aspect), and provide a place that students and teachers can contribute and share what they learn or ask questions.</p>
    <h3>Scenarios</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A parent has a birthday party planned for her daughter this coming Saturday and jumps on our site to see what the weather will be like. It turns out that it is going to be raining that day, ruining her outdoor party plans. Below the weather she sees an idea for rainy days list and decides to click on it. She finds some great rainy day game ideas for kids and isn't so bummed about change of plans after all.</li>
        <li>A teacher is teaching his class about different types of clouds. He has ideas of things that could be good, but is worried the kids will get bored. He goes onto The Weather Heather to try to find some ideas to spark the kids interest and see if he can find when his area will have some cloud coverage.He finds what he needs and goes into the teaching week confident and excited.</li>
        <li>A dad is planning a father-son hiking day, he wants to make sure it will be a nice day for it. He hops onto the site and finds it will be storming that day with some heavy thunder and lightning. Definitely not a day for hiking. He sees that some people have commented some really cool fun facts about lightning and thunder and storm clouds and he gets the idea to have a lighting day with his son instead. They learn about the storm together and enjoy it. Then his son later in life becomes a successful meteorologist.</li>
        <li>A student had fun learning about different clouds in class and wanted to see if that site had any information on his favorite type of storm: tornadoes. He navigates back to The Weather Heather and clicks in the search bar to see what he can find. He finds a lot of fun facts about them, and ways he can prepare to be safe during one. He leaves a comment about what he learned.</li>
        <li>A mom is homeschooling her kids. She decides it would be fun for them to learn about weather. She has each of them go on the site and choose a day that has weather that interests them that week. They go and learn about the different weathers they chose, then on the day it happens they teach each other the cool things they learn.</li>
